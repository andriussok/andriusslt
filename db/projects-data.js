The backend stock management system, Linnworks, was integrated with Shopify, requiring some data mapping to fit Shopify's structure. Key tasks included customising the theme with bespoke design layouts and creating product filters. The project was divided into four regional sites (US, EU, UK, AUS) to allow for localised content and pricing. The result was improved SEO performance and an easy-to-manage content for LAMODA's in-house team. Now project managed by another agency.",
